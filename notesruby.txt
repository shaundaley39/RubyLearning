Most interesting parts from Pragmatic Programmers Programming Ruby

Unit testing - awesome!
inject - a cool way of processing arrays & blocks (par passing up the chain)
Dynamic Blocks/ proc (108) for closure like things
Command Expansion (111) for passing operating system commands and receiving return
Conditional Execution (118) especially for appending to a hash from keys to arrays
Exceptions - burry in this stuff
Mixins - best application is in defining interfaces
Mixin Variable Hashing (144) - for instance specific states without variable clashing
// fear point: methods hierarchy is class > mixin > superclass > superclass mixins. So any internal method in a mixin should have a name that won't be accidentally overwritten in an including class
Unit testing structure & paths (182)

Environment variables (199)

Benchmarking support (636) and Profiling (696) - valgrind for ruby? Or just 10% as cool?

Looks Cool!!!

Sockets for networking (740)


General:
rdoc all code... explore further
explore open source licenses and include



Further learning tasks:
- build a well documented ruby gem, with a suitable license (for something... any ideas)
- build an API
- hit third party APIs
- build an application that uses sockets
- validate input (user input, file input, etc)
- comprehensive unit testing
- write a web trawler (especially important for Skyscanner discussions, and for generic transit graph generation)
- integrate with neo4j
- implement a C extension (289) (perhaps something involving threads? Perhaps something involving rational number computation? Perhaps something involving fourier transform libraries?
