Most interesting parts from Pragmatic Programmers Programming Ruby

Unit testing - awesome!
inject - a cool way of processing arrays & blocks (par passing up the chain)
Dynamic Blocks/ proc (108) for closure like things
Command Expansion (111) for passing operating system commands and receiving return
Conditional Execution (118) especially for appending to a hash from keys to arrays
Exceptions - burry in this stuff
Mixins - best application is in defining interfaces
Mixin Variable Hashing (144) - for instance specific states without variable clashing
// fear point: methods hierarchy is class > mixin > superclass > superclass mixins. So any internal method in a mixin should have a name that won't be accidentally overwritten in an including class
Internet Stuff (222)
